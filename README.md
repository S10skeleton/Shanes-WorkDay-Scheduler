# Shanes-WorkDay-Scheduler
Simple daily scheduler application 

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Description

I created a custom app consisting of a daily scheduler with minor design upgrades including custom colors and a dark theme background. You can save individual appointments that will remain even if the page is closed until it is reopened. The scheduler will notify you with color changing backgrounds, green being future appointments, red being the current appointment, and gray appointments have been completed. The scheduler heading shows the current date and time at the top updating every 10 sec. Also within 10 minutes of your next appointment the appointment time will highlight red to indicate it is almost time to get ready. I also added a Clear All button at the bottom of the page so I can easily clear the day for a new one
with a prompt for confirmation and a second prompt confirming reset.
